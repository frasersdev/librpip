librpip - A Library for Using Raspberry Pi Peripherals in User Space.

The library provides a way for non-privileged accounts (ie non-root) to access the peripherals such as i2c, spi, uarts and the gpio on a Raspberry PI. 
It has been tested on Arch Linux Arm (v7) 4.1, Raspbian Jessie 4.1 and Raspbian Wheezy 3.18.

Documentation
=============

Library documentation is at http://librpip.frasersdev.net/documentation/
By default librpip will have very little if any access to peripherals. 
You will need to configure the os and the peripherals on your Raspberry Pi. See:

 * http://librpip.frasersdev.net/linux/  
 * http://librpip.frasersdev.net/peripheral-config/ 
  
Librpip will detect and use whatever hardware has been made available via kernel modules
